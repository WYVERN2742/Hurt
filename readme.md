# ðŸ©¸ Hurt - Immersive Attributes

Want a more immersive experience? Is it not obvious enough when on low health?
Well look no further! Hurt is a mod centred around making you *feel* that low
health or stamina bar, with screenspace effects to provide an immersive experience.

Hurt also aims to be configurable, with a fully featured MCM menu and plenty of
options. Only want the health effects? Easily done.
